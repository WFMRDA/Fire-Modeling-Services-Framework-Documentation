Landscape Service
=================

The Landscape Service allows users to create, edit and download landscapes files.
Landscape files can be created in either geotiff or LCP which is a raster file comprised of spatial information representing topography (slope, elevation, and aspect), fuel model, and canopy characteristics including canopy cover, canopy base height, canopy height, and canopy bulk density.
