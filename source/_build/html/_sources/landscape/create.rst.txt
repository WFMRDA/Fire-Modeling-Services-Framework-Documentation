Read the docs, please
*********************

The documents in this section
(will) provide generic information about
the technical documentation generator (Sphinx_),
the version control system (Git_),
the project management system and issue tracking system (TaskMan *aka* Redmine)
and the helpdesk and support ticket system (OTRS).

It may also contain miscellaneous sections on **How-to...**
do things in other tools that we may need to use
(e.g. Forum).

It's a work-in-progress and it always will...
